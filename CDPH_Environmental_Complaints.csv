DUMPING INTO STORM DRAIN FROM A REPAIR SHOP.

UPON ARRIVAL A PERIMETER SURVEY OF THE LOCATION AND ADJACENT
AREAS WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EXACT DUMPING STATION. I CAME TO A STOP
DURING THE SURVEY AFTER DISCOVERING WHAT APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE A SMALL POOL OF OILY
SLUDGE AROUND THE GARBAGE DUMPSTER BELONGING TO ADVANCE AUTO PARTS LOCATED AT 4301
S ASHLAND.

AS I WENT TOWARDS THE SEWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OIL DUMPED ON
THE GROUND TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK OF INSIDE THE DRAIN, I FOUND MY SHOE HALF IMMERSED
IN SOME GREASY SUBSTANCE. I TESTED THE SEWER WITH A DIPPING STICK, AND IT WAS
CONFIRMED THAT SEVERAL GALLONS OF AUTOMOTIVE FLUID INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
MOTOR OIL, ANTI-FREEZE, GREASE, AND LUBRICANTS MUST HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY DISPOSED
IN THE SEWER.

I PROCEEDED TO ADVANCE AUTO PARTS OFFICE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.
I MET WITH THE STORE MANAGER CASTILLO MARIA AND STATE THE PURPOSE OF MY VISIT.
SHE DETAILED TO ME HOW THE SHOP WAS IN THE BEGINNING ACCEPTING WASTE OIL FROM THE
PUBLIC TO BE RECYCLED FOR NO CHARGE TO THEM, BUT THEY SHOULD BRING OIL INSIDE
THE STORE. BUT AS TIME WENT ON, SHE SAID THEY STOPPED BRING THE OIL INSIDE THE STORE
BUT STARTED TO LEAVE SEVERAL GALLONS OF OIL AT THEIR GARBAGE CONTAINER AND THE
NEXT THING WAS DISPOSING OF THE OIL IN THE SEWER.   

I TOLD HER THAT THE AREA WAS NOT PROTECTED AND SECURED WITH HIGH
IRON FENCE AROUND THE GARBAGE DUMPSTER. IT SEEMS LIKE THE PUBLIC HAVE 24HOURS EASY
ACCESS TO THE GARBAGE AREA TO DUMP, BUT IF IT CAN BE PROPERLY SECURED AND
PROTECTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. 

DURING MY EXIT INTERVIEW I TOLD THE MANAGER THE INSPECTION
RESULT AND INFORMED HER THAT THE FACILITY WAS FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE CITY
MUNICIPAL CODE 7-28-440 DUMPING ON REAL ESTATE WITHOUT A PERMIT, AND 11-4-1500 TREATMENT

THE CLEANING BATHS CONTAIN SOAPS AND RUN THE LENGTH OF THE NICKEL PLATING BRIGHTENER BATH AND HAVE DIRECT VENTILATION FROM THE BATHS TO THE EXTERIOR.
