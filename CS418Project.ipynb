Another minor change we made was we're more focusing on the trend related to the tempeature change instead of using classification to predict the tempeture at that time versus what it actually was."

    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "One hypothesis that we had was that was temperatures increased throughout the year, so would complaints of the air quality. We tested this hypothesis by creating two visualizations. One for the average temperatures in Chicago per month in 2021, and another for the number of complaints and their types per month in 2021. What we saw from the graphs showed some promise to this hypothesis. We saw that both complaints of air quality and average temperatures were highest in month 8 (August) and also that complaints of air quality were typically highest in the 4-9 months which are during spring and summer (months with the highest temperatures). We believe that investigating further with more years could help us determine if there is a strong coorelation here."
